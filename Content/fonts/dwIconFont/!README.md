#This is an important note#

When updating the fonts, e.g. after adding or changing icons, please run the **_icons-fontface-definition.tt** template in the dwtheme folder.

This is needed in order to refresh the links for the fonts, so that they get new URLs. Then it is easily possible to flush the caches
which store old versions of the fonts.

At questions, ask [CHW](mailto:christoph.weidling@docuware.com?subject=Question%20about%20dwIconFont).
